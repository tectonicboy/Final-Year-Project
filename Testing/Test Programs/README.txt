Notes on how I tested the binary number library:

The text files with "correct" in their names are the correct results generated by my laptop's processor.

The text files with "bin lib" in their names are the results generated by my binary numbers library.

Comparing the contents of each pair of text files in a file-comparison program called Meld 
reveals that the two files in each pair are identical, therefore the binary library has passed exhaustive testing.
